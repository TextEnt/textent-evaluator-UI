# TextEnt Evaluator UI

[![Made with Replit Badge](https://replit.com/badge?caption=Made%20with%20Replit)](https:/.replit.com/)

A simple web-based application for assessing the output of LLMs on the NLP task of predicting the fictional time and space of French theatre plays.
The app shows the model's prediction, and allows the user to assign one or more scores. LLM predictions are pre-computed and uploaded to the application via a TSV file.
