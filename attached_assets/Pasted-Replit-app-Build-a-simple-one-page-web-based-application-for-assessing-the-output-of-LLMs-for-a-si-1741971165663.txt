Replit app 

Build a simple one-page web-based application for assessing the output of LLMs for a simple NLP task (prediction of fictional time and space in French theatre plays).
The app shows the model prediction, and allows the user to insert one or more scores. LLM predictions are pre-computed and will be uploaded to the application as a CSV file.

The page presents three elements:
A short description of the input document (author, title, publication date)
The model’s prediction for “time” with an input field for inserting a value between 0-1 (should be validated)
The model’s prediction for “space” with an input field for inserting a value between 0-1 (should be validated)
Tooltips should appear when hovering on the input fields, and should display the assessment criteria (to be provided in a config file).
A progress bar showing how many responses have been assessed and how many still remain. 

Functionalities:
User starts a new job by uploading a CSV with a predefined structure; the input file should be validated for compliance.
Here is the list of column headers in the input CSV file: "response_id" , "prompt_id" , "model_id" , "document_id" , "author" , "title" , "publication_date" , "document_length" , "keep_fine_tuning" , "gt_period" , "pred_period" , "score_period_string" , "gt_timeframe" , "pred_timeframe" , "score_period_timeframe" , "gt_period_reasoning" , "pred_period_reasoning" , "score_period_reasoning" , "gt_location" , "pred_location" , "score_location_string" , "gt_location_QID" , "pred_location_qid" , "score_location_qid" , "gt_location_reason" , "pred_location_reasoning" , "score_location_reasoning" , "total_score"
User can move back and forth between answers. Every time a score is entered by the user, it should be persisted in a database (or written directly to a file for simplicity).
User should be able to search through the responses
User can export the results at any time to CSV.
User authentication: it should be kept as simple as possible (sign up/in, then login with username and password)
